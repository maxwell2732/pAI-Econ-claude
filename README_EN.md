## Overview

**pAI-Econ-claude** is a **human-in-the-loop Claude Code Skill** designed for empirical economists who want to strengthen the theoretical foundations of their research.

It does not attempt to replace the original work of theoretical economists, nor does it claim to automatically discover new theoretical frontiers. Instead, it bridges theory and empirics: helping empirical researchers identify appropriate canonical model families, clarify core economic mechanisms, pinpoint what a model extension adds beyond existing theory, and translate empirical questions into more rigorous theoretical frameworks.

Many empirical papers do not lack data, identification strategies, or estimation results — what is often weak is the theoretical mechanism: Why should this phenomenon hold? Which canonical model does it correspond to? What does adding a new variable change? Are propositions merely implied by assumptions? Do welfare implications extend beyond estimation results?

pAI-Econ-claude provides a structured workflow for these questions. Through canonical model matching, theory lineage checks, model primitive generation, assumption audits, candidate propositions, proof sketches, and counterexample checks, it helps researchers transform an empirical puzzle into a theoretical framework that can be discussed, reviewed, and collaboratively developed.

In short, it is not an AI theoretical economist — it is a theory modeling scaffold for empirical researchers:

> Helping you understand where your empirical findings fit in the theoretical literature, what mechanism is missing, and what questions to bring to a theory collaborator.

---

## What Problem Does It Solve?

The theoretical analysis component of economics research often stalls not at "how to write it" but at much earlier stages:

- Is the research question actually clear?
- Which canonical model tradition does this idea belong to?
- What exactly does the new mechanism add relative to the canonical model?
- Are assumptions too strong — included only to deliver the desired conclusion?
- Are propositions non-trivial, or merely implied by assumptions?
- What are the gaps in proof sketches?
- Do simple counterexamples exist?
- Does the economic interpretation extend beyond the formal results?

**pAI-Econ-claude's role is to make the theory modeling process explicit, documented, and traceable, while preserving human judgment at critical decision points.**

---

## Target Users & Usage Responsibility

### Target Users

This Skill is designed for **junior researchers with foundational training in economic theory**, including:

- Graduate students (Master's or PhD) in economics, management, or related fields
- Assistant professors or postdoctoral researchers whose primary work is empirical but who want to strengthen theoretical mechanisms
- Researchers familiar with microeconomic foundations (utility maximization, equilibrium concepts, information structures)

Using this Skill requires the following baseline competencies:

- Ability to independently judge whether an equilibrium concept (e.g., BNE, SPE, competitive equilibrium) is appropriate for a given research setting
- Ability to assess whether a proposition is non-trivial or merely implied by assumptions
- Ability to evaluate whether a theoretical mechanism has a meaningful correspondence with an empirical identification strategy

**This Skill is not designed for researchers with no background in economic theory modeling.** Users who cannot independently assess the quality of AI-generated model structures and propositions cannot take appropriate academic responsibility for the outputs.

### Usage Responsibility

> **Users bear full responsibility for any work they publish.**

This Skill is an assistive tool. All outputs — including model primitives, propositions, proof sketches, manuscript frameworks, and references — must be independently reviewed by the user before being used for any academic writing or publication purpose.

Specifically:

- **Proof sketches are not formal proofs.** Steps labeled `GAP` or `FALSE_RISK` must be independently derived and verified by the researcher before being written into a paper.
- **References must be independently verified.** Although Stage 2 and the pre-PDF generation step include mandatory web verification nodes, the researcher bears full responsibility for the accuracy of the final published citation list.
- **Theoretical contribution requires researcher judgment.** AI cannot determine whether a proposition has sufficient novelty to meet journal standards — this judgment must be made by the researcher and collaborators based on thorough knowledge of the relevant literature.
- **Model selection requires researcher evaluation.** Canonical Model Matching recommendations are advisory only; the researcher must make the final selection based on their own understanding of the relevant theoretical tradition.

The authors of this project accept no responsibility for the accuracy, originality, or sufficiency of any content generated using this Skill in academic publication.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxwell2732/pAI-Econ-claude.git
cd pAI-Econ-claude
```

Open Claude Code in that directory — the slash command is immediately available:

```text
/theoretical-economics-claude-skill "Your theoretical economics research idea"
```

---

## Use Cases

pAI-Econ-claude supports theoretical ideas at different stages of maturity. You don't need to run the full pipeline every time — choose the entry point that fits your task.

### 1. Model Extension Mode: Extend a Canonical Model with a New Mechanism

Use this mode when you already know the approximate model family and want to add a new mechanism.

Example:

```text
/theoretical-economics-claude-skill "
mode: model_extension

Extend a search model by adding product healthfulness and costly attention to nutrition labels.
Can a front-of-package label increase the probability that consumers choose healthier food?
"
```

The Skill will help you answer:

- Which canonical search model does this idea inherit from?
- What does the new healthfulness mechanism change?
- When will consumers actively check nutrition labels?
- Does reducing information costs necessarily increase purchases of healthy food?
- Are there counterexamples or boundary cases?
- Does this extension have sufficient theoretical contribution?

---

### 2. Phenomenon-to-Model Mode: Match a Theoretical Model to an Economic Phenomenon

Use this mode when you have a phenomenon or mechanism intuition but are unsure which theoretical model to use.

Example:

```text
/theoretical-economics-claude-skill "
mode: phenomenon_to_model

I want to incorporate genetic endowment into a health capital framework.
Genetic endowment affects productivity through childhood environment, health investment,
and human capital formation. Which theoretical model is most suitable?
"
```

The Skill will compare multiple candidate model families, such as:

- Grossman health capital model
- Becker / Ben-Porath human capital investment model
- Cunha-Heckman skill formation framework
- Roy model of comparative advantage
- Lifecycle investment model
- Intergenerational human capital model

It will then recommend a baseline model and explain why others do or do not fit.

---

### 3. Model Critique Mode: Audit an Existing Theoretical Model

If you already have model primitives, assumptions, or propositions, you can ask the Skill to review them like a theory journal referee.

```text
/theoretical-economics-claude-skill "
mode: model_critique

Here is my model setup:
[Paste model primitives, timing, utility function, equilibrium definition, and propositions]

Please audit model coherence, assumptions, non-triviality, proof gaps, and possible counterexamples.
"
```

Key checks include:

- Is the model closed?
- Is the timing clear?
- Is the information structure complete?
- Is the equilibrium concept appropriate?
- Are assumptions included merely to deliver desired conclusions?
- Are propositions non-trivial?
- Are there logical jumps in proof sketches?
- Do simple 2-agent, 2-period, binary-action counterexamples exist?

---

### 4. Full Pipeline Mode: Run the Complete Theory Workflow from a Research Idea

Use the full pipeline when you have only an early-stage idea and want to go from intuition all the way to a paper framework.

```text
/theoretical-economics-claude-skill "
mode: full_pipeline

Investigate whether a principal facing a privately informed agent can achieve first-best efficiency
through a forcing contract when the agent's outside option is type-dependent.
"
```

Full output includes:

- Refined research puzzle
- Literature positioning plan
- Canonical model match
- Model primitives
- Assumption audit
- Candidate propositions
- Proof sketches
- Counterexamples
- Economic interpretation
- Manuscript skeleton (markdown + LaTeX source + academic PDF compiled with pdflatex)

---

### 5. Manuscript Skeleton Only: Generate a Paper Framework

Use this mode when the model, propositions, and main conclusions are reasonably clear and you just need to organize them into a working paper structure.

```text
/theoretical-economics-claude-skill "
mode: manuscript_skeleton_only

Here are my model, propositions, and proof sketches:
[Paste existing content]

Please organize them into a theoretical economics working paper skeleton.
"
```

---

## Workflow

pAI-Econ-claude uses a staged, traceable human-AI collaboration process.

**About Stage 2a — Empirical Reality Check:**

After literature positioning and before entering theoretical modeling, the pipeline runs a minimal empirical reality check (Stage 2a) protected by **Gate 1b (Reality Fit Gate)**. The purpose is to verify — using web search — that the researcher's described real-world context is consistent with the factual requirements of the proposed model structure. Specifically, it checks:

- Does the market's actual concentration data support a "dominant firm + atomistic fringe" structure, or is it actually an oligopoly?
- Are important strategic competitors being omitted?
- Is a differentiated-product market being incorrectly modeled as a homogeneous good?
- Are distribution or regulatory constraints being mischaracterized as production capacity constraints?
- Is there documented evidence for claimed urban-rural, regional, or group differences?

Gate 1b produces three verdicts:
- **PASS**: Factual assumptions match available evidence — proceed to Stage 3.
- **CONDITIONAL PASS (REFRAME)**: Some assumptions are unverified — the pipeline can proceed, but the paper must explicitly describe a *stylized* market rather than claiming to describe a specific real market.
- **FAIL (REROUTE)**: A core assumption is contradicted by evidence — loop back to Stage 1 to restate the research context, or redirect Stage 3b to a more appropriate canonical model family.

**About Stage 7b — Numerical Simulation and Computational Illustration (optional):**

> Numerical simulation is optional and runs only after explicit user approval. When selected, the workflow produces reproducible code, machine-readable results, and figures in both PNG and PDF formats. Numerical evidence is used for verification, counterexample search, and illustration, not as a substitute for formal proof.

After Stage 7 (Proof Sketch) completes, the pipeline always pauses at **HiL-N1** and asks whether to run numerical simulation. The full branching logic:

```text
Stage 7 — Proof Sketch (+ Gate 4)
  → Ask user whether to run numerical simulation (HiL-N1)
      NO        → proceed directly to Stage 8 (no numerical artifacts created)
      PLAN ONLY → generate numerical_simulation_plan.md and pause (no code executed)
      CUSTOM    → collect user specifications (propositions, variables, ranges,
                  axes, simulation types, figure formats) → generate plan
      YES       → generate plan
  → user approves plan (HiL-N2 — no code may run before APPROVE PLAN)
  → generate code → run simulation → save machine-readable CSV results
  → generate PNG and PDF figures
  → Gate 4b — Numerical Integrity Gate
  → human review of numerical results (HiL-N3)
  → Stage 8 — Counterexample Finder (with numerical handoff)
```

Every parameter is classified (theoretical normalization / empirically grounded / illustrative / user specified), every numerical result carries an epistemic-status label (e.g., `NUMERICALLY VERIFIED FOR SPECIFIED PARAMETERS`, `COUNTEREXAMPLE FOUND`, `NOT A PROOF`), and figures enter the manuscript only if the researcher explicitly selects `USE FIGURES IN MANUSCRIPT` at HiL-N3 (when authorized, the manuscript includes 1–2 demonstration figures in the main text by default; the rest stay in the workspace or Appendix). A numerical counterexample to a core proposition blocks the unmodified proposition from Stage 10 until it is resolved at Stage 8 / HiL-6.

## Model Library

pAI-Econ-claude includes a `model_library/` for matching canonical theoretical model families before formal modeling begins.

This step is critical because theoretical economics research should not start from scratch by "inventing models from thin air" — it should first answer:

> What canonical model does the current research idea most closely resemble?  
> What does it inherit? What does it change? Where is the new mechanism?

---

## Quality Control Gates

The Skill includes multiple quality gates to avoid the problem of work that "looks like theory but has no theoretical contribution."

| Gate | Name | Checks | On Failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gate 1 | Novelty Risk | Whether the question may already be answered in the literature | Return to puzzle refinement |
| Gate 2b | Canonical Fit | Whether model family matches; whether it is just a renamed canonical model | Return to canonical model matching |
| Gate 2c | Theory Lineage | Whether theoretical ancestors, inherited content, and new mechanisms are explicit | Return to canonical model matching |
| Gate 2 | Model Coherence | Whether model primitives, timing, and information structure are consistent | Return to model primitives |
| Gate 3 | Non-triviality | Whether propositions are non-trivial, not merely implied by assumptions | Return to assumptions or propositions |

| Gate 4b | Numerical Integrity (optional; only if Stage 7b ran) | Equation–code consistency, reproducibility, parameter transparency, numerical robustness, result completeness, epistemic-status labels | Return to Stage 7b (fix code/parameters) or Stage 6 (revise proposition) |
| Gate 5 | Economic Meaning | Whether economic interpretation extends beyond formal results | Return to economic interpretation |

Gate failures are never hidden or repackaged as passes. The Skill explicitly outputs:

- Failure reason
- Severity
- Recommended loopback stage
- Whether a human override is possible

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

Critical judgments in theoretical economics should not be made automatically by an agent. The Skill therefore includes mandatory researcher-confirmation nodes.

| Checkpoint | Location | Researcher Must Decide |
|---|---|---|
| HiL-1 | After Puzzle Refinement | Whether to accept the research question |
| HiL-2 | After Literature Positioning | Whether to accept the literature positioning |
| HiL-3 | After Persona Council | Whether to accept the theory review conclusions |
| HiL-4 | After Model Primitives | Confirm the equilibrium concept — this is a hard stop |
| HiL-5 | After Proposition Generator | Which propositions to carry into subsequent analysis |
| HiL-N1 | After Proof Sketch | Whether to run numerical simulation at all (YES / NO / PLAN ONLY / CUSTOM) — Stage 7b never runs by default |
| HiL-N2 | After the simulation plan is written | Approve the plan and parameter design — no code executes before APPROVE PLAN |
| HiL-N3 | After simulation + Gate 4b | Accept/revise numerical results; authorize (or refuse) manuscript use of figures |
| HiL-6 | After Counterexample Finder | How to handle counterexamples and boundary cases |

**HiL-4 is a hard stop.** Equilibrium concepts — Nash, SPE, BNE, PBE, competitive equilibrium, etc. — must be confirmed by the researcher before advancing.

---

## Five Theory Reviewer Personas

In the Persona Council stage, the Skill simulates five types of theory economics reviewers in two rounds of discussion.

| Persona | Focus |
|---|---|
| Mechanism Theorist | Is the mechanism clear, interesting, and non-trivial? |
| Mathematical Referee | Can the model be formalized? Is the proof likely to hold? |
| Economic Intuition Referee | Do the results have genuine economic meaning? |
| Journal Positioning Referee | More like a theory or applied-theory journal target? |
| Brutal Skeptic | What is the strongest objection? |

The Brutal Skeptic's role is not to support the project but to attack it. If an idea can withstand this persona's critique, it is more worth pursuing.

## Design Principles

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop, Not Fully Automated Research

Core judgments in theoretical economics — whether a research question is meaningful, whether an equilibrium concept is appropriate, whether a proposition is worth pursuing, whether a counterexample is fatal — must be made by the researcher.

AI can assist with generation, review, and rebuttal, but should not substitute for researcher judgment on irreversible decisions.

---

### 2. Match Canonical Models First, Then Build New Ones

Before formally defining model primitives, the Skill runs **Canonical Model Matching**.

This step forces an answer to:

- What is the closest canonical model?
- What structural elements does the current model inherit?
- What is the new mechanism?
- Are the new results derivable from the canonical model alone?

This reduces the risk of "canonical model with a new name."

---

### 3. Honestly Label Uncertainty

The Proof Sketch stage does not package sketches as rigorous proofs. Each proof step is labeled:

- `SOLID`
- `PLAUSIBLE`
- `GAP`
- `FALSE_RISK`

This allows researchers to clearly see what is relatively secure and what remains conjecture-level.

---

### 4. Actively Search for Counterexamples

Stage 8 specifically searches for counterexamples and boundary cases, including:

- 2-agent case
- 2-period case
- Binary-action case
- Corner solution
- Alternative equilibrium
- Violation of key assumptions

The goal of this step is not to make the model look better, but to find early where it might fail.
